Coding itself is similar to art: it can require attention to detail from the crafter, but it also necessitates a standard that ensures the work is accessible and maintainable for others. In the same way an artist follows principles of composition and color theory, a developer must comply with such standards in order to transform raw logic off their head into something magnificent if done well. The discipline fosters a collaborative environment where every contributor can understand and build upon the existing foundation without confusion from the former. Hence, there should (or must for the better) exist a set of guidelines that helps developers alike to lead them to develop their products.
