summary: "A simple 3D animation developed in Maya for the class ICS 481."
---

This is a 10-second clip I made for my first project for ICS 481 or Introduction to Computer Graphics. The scene is based off the tutorial playlist from Maya themselves. My rocket and moon are modeled with various 3D shapes and are applied with various layers of materials, textures, and shaders to create a stylized space environment. The animation involves the rocket being squashed before lifting off to land on the moon, and later falls due to gravity to the ground, and is rendered by pre-installed Arnold renderer. 

This assignment introduces me to the realm of computer graphics and modeling, for how the shapes and lighting interacts with each other both by alone and during animation. Further in the course, I was further exposed to more advanced concepts that are based off the basics from this assignment.
