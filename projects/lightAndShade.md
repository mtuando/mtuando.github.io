This video demonstrates a sample 3D graphics scene featuring a sphere and a cylinder rendered with lighting and shading that I implemented with OpenGL API under Common Lisp language. It highlights light interactions with curved surfaces, showing surface normals, mesh structure, and shading effects --- both rough and smooth.
