summary: "A computer graphics displaying polyhedrons orbiting around in a circular motion, a project for ICS 481."
---

This was the third project I had done for ICS 481. In this project, I have implemented 3D objects, modeling, lighting, and animation using OpenGL API via Common Lisp programming language in order to achieve what is being shown. The 10-second animation potrays randomly generated polyhedrons automatically jumping up and down and rotate randomly in 3D space, and orbiting arond the origin of the plane.

There are also presences of backwards culling and polygon/polyhedron normal line implementations, as well as the ability to use the mouse to freely move around the 3D space.
